Hi, we're St. Bam, a chamber choir based in New York City. [Learn more about us](/about.html), and read on for information on our upcoming concert.

### Upcoming concert: "To the Renaissance... and Beyond!"
Our inaugural concert will be on <strong>August 26, 2018 at 4pm</strong> at <strong>The Church of St. Edward the Martyr</strong> (109th st. and 5th ave).

Join us for an afternoon of a cappella choral music; we'll be singing some of our favorites of the Renaissance, and a few other things besides. Suggested donation is $10, but all may pay what they wish -- half the proceeds will go towards St. Bam, the rest to charity.
