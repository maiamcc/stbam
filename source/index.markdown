Hi, we're St. Bam, a nine-voice chamber choir based in New York City. [Learn more about us](/about.html).

We just held our inagural concert, **"To the Renaissance... and Beyond!"** Stay tuned for video/photos/recordings.

Thanks to your generous donations, **we raised $240 for [Planned Parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthood.org)**, as well as covering our operational costs for the concert and giving the group a little runway for our next season.

Many many thanks to our fabulous hosts at [The Church of St. Edward the Martyr](http://saintedwardthemartyr.com/), and to everyone who came out to hear us sing, who tuned into the livestream, or otherwise supported us in our quest to make beautiful music. Until next time! ðŸ‘‹
